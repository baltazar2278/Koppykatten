Koppykatten is a simple python script that I turned in to a EXE. The idea with the program is to be used to copy and paste text, but it does type it out letter by letter to mimic how we type. Use it however you want it is however quite useless as of new. In the future I might make changes to it so that it better suits my needs.


In order to use the program you need to:
1 Extract the folder "Koppykatten" from the zip.
2 Run the EXE.
3 Use "crtl+X" to cut text.
4 Use "j" to paste the text.
